# ChipJabber-BasicBBI

What the heck is Body Biasing Injection? This is a method of injecting faults into the backside of an IC, which results in an injection somewhere between EMFI & Laser-FI. This work has been presented since 2012, yet there has been less follow on work compared to topics such as EMFI & Laser FI. ChipJabber-BasicBBI tries to help with that by making available both the injection tool & target for all!

## BBI Made Simple

BBI uses a simple idea - use a physical probe on the IC die *backside*. While it turns out that WLCSP devices expose the backside (or have some flimsy film over it you can remove easily), allowing you to perform BBI without becoming [John McMaster](https://twitter.com/johndmcmaster).

The idea of this repo is to perform BBI using a simple probe, which uses a transformer to generate the required pulses. This looks something like this:
